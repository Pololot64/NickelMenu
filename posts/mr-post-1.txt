[B]Troubleshooting/FAQ:[/B][LIST]
[*] I don't see any menu items in the main menu
    [I]Try re-installing NickelMenu. If it still doesn't appear, please reboot and post the contents of the syslog.[/I]

    [I]You probably triggered the failsafe (if you rebooted within 20 seconds after first turning it on).[/I]

[*] When I try to open a file in KOBOeReader/.adds/nm, I get asked what I want to open it with
    [I]Open it with a text editor, for example, Notepad, Notepad++, or Visual Studio Code.[/I]
[*] When I open a configuration file, everything is jumbled in one long line
