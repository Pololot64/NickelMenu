[B][SIZE=5]NickelMenu v0.1.2[/SIZE][/B]

This release adds two new actions: `nickel_misc:home` and `nickel_wifi`.
[CODE]nickel_wifi - one of:
    autoconnect        - attempts to enable and connect to wifi (similar to what happens when you open a link)
    autoconnect_silent - attempts to connect to wifi in the background (does nothing if wifi is disabled, the battery is low, is already connected, or there aren't any known networks in range) (no errors are shown) (similar to what happens when you turn on the Kobo)
    enable             - enables WiFi (but doesn't necessarily connect to it)
    disable            - disables WiFi
    toggle             - toggles WiFi (but doesn't necessarily connect to it)[/CODE]
