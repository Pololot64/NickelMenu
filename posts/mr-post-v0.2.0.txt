[B][SIZE=5]NickelMenu v0.2.0[/SIZE][/B]

This release is the second major feature update for NickelMenu.
[LIST]
[*] [B]Breaking change:[/B] For simplicity, `nickel_extras:web_browser` has been renamed to nickel_browser. Note that if you aren't providing any additional arguments, you still need to include a `:` (like `menu_item:main:Web Browser:nickel_browser:`).
[*] [B]Breaking change:[/B] To improve future-proofing so breaking changes won't need to be made in the future and to make the new option for explicit values simpler, the arguments for `nickel_setting` have changed. Instead of only specifying the setting name to toggle, you specify the action (toggle, enable, disable), and then the setting name. For example, instead of using `nickel_setting:invert`, you need to use `nickel_setting:toggle:invert`. This will make it easier to deal with non-boolean settings in the future, or to add additional setting-related functionality.
[*] NickelMenu now supports reloading configuration files without a reboot.
[*] Automatic reloading for generators are also supported.
[*] The configuration parser has been rewritten and is now cleaner and more efficient (this change shouldn't be noticeable in general).
[*] Explicit values for nickel_setting are now supported. You can now do things like `nickel_setting:enable:force_wifi` and `nickel_setting:disable:force_wifi`.
[*] Custom URLs for `nickel_browser` are now supported.
[*] There is a new `modal` option for `nickel_browser` to open it as a pop-up window. This works from any screen, including the web browser itself.
[*] You can now add custom CSS stylesheets to all web pages with the `nickel_browser` action.
